  abstract = 	 {Accurate identification and classification of immune cells within tissue samples are critical for understanding disease mechanisms and predicting treatment responses as a cornerstone for personalized medicine. Traditional histopathology relies on hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining, which provides structural context but lacks specificity for immune cell sub-types, preventing pathologists from more precise identification. In contrast, immunofluorescent (IF) staining enables precise targeting of specific markers, but this recently developed technology is very costly and not widely applied in clinical practice yet. In this work, we propose a method to leverage registered pairs of H&E and IF stained images from the same tissue to automatically generate cell type labels for H&E from IF marker expression, allowing for precise identification. In particular, we demonstrate the feasibility of lymphocyte sub-typing from H&E images by training cell-level classifiers to accurately distinguish T-cells subtypes (CD45 / CD3e / CD4 / CD8a).

However, existing medical SAMs are not suitable for the multi-scale nature of whole-slide images (WSIs), restricting their effectiveness. To resolve this drawback, we present WSI-SAM, enhancing SAM with precise object segmentation capabilities for histopathology images using multi-resolution patches, while preserving its efficient, prompt-driven design, and zero-shot abilities. To fully exploit pretrained knowledge while minimizing training overhead, we keep SAM frozen, introducing only minimal extra parameters and computational overhead. In particular, we introduce High-Resolution (HR) token, Low-Resolution (LR) token and dual mask decoder. This decoder integrates the original SAM mask decoder with a lightweight fusion module that integrates features at multiple scales. Instead of predicting a mask independently, we integrate HR and LR token at intermediate layer to jointly learn features of the same object across multiple resolutions. Experiments show that our WSI-SAM outperforms state-of-the-art SAM and its variants. In particular, our model outperforms SAM by 4.1 and 2.5 percent points on a ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) segmentation tasks and breast cancer metastasis segmentation task (CAMELYON16 data set).

A constant challenge in the analysis of digital Whole Slide Images (WSIs) is the problem of aggregating tens of thousands of tile-level image embeddings to a slide-level representation. Due to the prevalent use of datasets created for genomic research, such as TCGA, for method development, the performance of these techniques on diagnostic slides from clinical practice has been inadequately explored. This study conducts a thorough benchmarking analysis of ten slide-level aggregation techniques across nine clinically relevant tasks, including diagnostic assessment, biomarker classification, and outcome prediction. The results yield following key insights: (1) Embeddings derived from domainspecific (histological images) FMs outperform those from generic ImageNet-based models across aggregation methods. (2) Spatial-aware aggregators enhance the performance significantly when using ImageNet pre-trained models but not when using FMs. (3) No single model excels in all tasks and spatially-aware models do not show general superiority as it would be expected. These findings underscore the need for more adaptable and universally applicable aggregation techniques, guiding future research towards tools that better meet the evolving needs of clinical-AI in pathology.

To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework termed CDNet, which combines Causal Inference Module (CIM) with Diversified Aggregation Convolution (DAC) techniques. The DAC module is designed which incorporates diverse downsampling features through a simple, parameter-free attention module (SimAM), aiming to overcome the problems of edge blurring. Furthermore, we introduce CIM to leverage sample weighting by directly removing the spurious correlations between features for every input sample and concentrating more on the correlation between features and labels. Extensive experiments on the MoNuSeg and GLySAC datasets yielded promising results, with mean intersection over union (mIoU) and Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) scores increasing by 3.59\% and 2.61\%, and 2.71\% and 2.04\%, respectively, outperforming other state-of-the-art methods.}

  abstract = 	 {Pathology reports are increasingly being used for development of vision-language models. Because the reports often include information that cannot directly be derived from paired images, careful selection of information is required to prevent hallucinations in tasks like report generation. In this paper, we present a language model for subsentence segmentation based on the information content, as part of a preprocessing workflow for 27,500 pathology reports of cutaneous melanocytic lesions. After initial clean up, the reports were first translated from Dutch to English and then segmented by separate language models. Both models were developed using an iterative approach, in which the development dataset was expanded with manually corrected model predictions for previously unannotated reports before finetuning the next version of the models. Over the course of eight iterations, the development dataset was in the end scaled up to 1,500 translated and annotated reports. On the independent test set of 3,597 sentences from 150 reports, 219 translation errors (6,1\%) of different severities were counted. The subsentence segmentation model achieved a strong predictive performance on the test set with a macro average F1 -score of 0.921 (95\% CI, 0.890-0.940) and a weighted average F1 -score of 0.952 (95\% CI, 0.944-0.960) over 13 different classes. The remaining 25,850 unannotated reports were translated and segmented using the final models to complete the dataset preprocessing. Differences in word count and class distribution between section types of the reports were explored in preparation for future vision-language modeling. The presented methodology is generic and can, therefore, easily be extended to multiple or different pathology domains beyond melanocytic skin lesions.

While advances in visionâ€“language modeling raise new oppor- tunities for analysis of such images, the gigapixel-scale size of whole slide images (WSIs) introduces unique challenges. Additionally, pathology reports simultaneously highlight key findings from small regions while also aggregating interpretation across multiple slides, often making it difficult to create robust imageâ€“text pairs. As such, pathology reports remain a largely untapped source of supervision in computational pathology, with most efforts relying on region-of-interest annotations or self-supervision at the patch-level. In this work, we develop a visionâ€“language model based on the BLIP-2 framework using WSIs paired with curated text from pathology reports. This enables applications utilizing a shared imageâ€“text embedding space, such as text or image retrieval for finding cases of interest, as well as integration of the WSI encoder with a frozen large language model (LLM) for WSI-based generative text capabilities such as report generation or AI-in-the-loop interactions. We utilize a de-identified dataset of over 350,000 WSIs and diagnostic text pairs, spanning a wide range of diagnoses, procedure types, and tissue types. We present pathologist evaluation of text generation and text retrieval using WSI embeddings, as well as results for WSI classification and workflow prioritization (slide-level triaging). Model-generated text for WSIs was rated by pathologists as accurate, without clinically significant error or omission, for 78\% of WSIs on average. This work demonstrates exciting potential capabilities for language-aligned WSI embeddings.}

Traditional IHC techniques generally involve a single stain that highlights a single target protein, but this can be enriched with stain multiplexing. Our proposed method leverages sequential staining to train a model to virtually stain multiplex additional IHC on top of a digitally scanned whole slide image (WSI), without requiring a complex setup or any additional tissue sections and stains. To this end, we designed a novel model architecture, guided by the physical sequential staining process which provides superior performance. The model was optimized using a custom loss function that combines mean squared error (MSE) with semantic information, allowing the model to focus on learning the relevant differences between the input and ground truth. As an example application, we consider the problem of detecting macro-phages on PD-L1 IHC 22C3 pharmDx NSCLC WSIs. We demonstrated virtual stain multiplexing CD68 on top of PD-L1 22C3 pharmDx stained slides, which helps to detect macrophages and distinguish them from PD-L1+ tumor cells, which are often visually similar. Our pilot-study results showed significant improvement in a pathologistâ€™s ability to distinguish macrophages when using the virtually stain multiplexed CD68 decision supporting layer.}

Various color augmentation methods have been proposed to generate synthetic images during training to make models more robust, eliminating the need for stain normalization during test time. Many color augmentation methods leverage domain labels to generate synthetic images. This approach causes three significant challenges to scaling such a model. Firstly, incorporating data from a new domain into deep-learning models trained on existing domain labels is not straightforward. Secondly, dependency on domain labels prevents the use of pathology images without domain labels to improve model performance. Finally, implementation of these methods becomes complicated when multiple domain labels (e.g., patient identification, medical center, etc) are associated with a single image. We introduce ContriMix, a novel domain label free stain color augmentation method based on DRIT++, a style-transfer method. ContriMix leverages sample stain color variation within a training minibatch and random mixing to extract content and attribute information from pathology images. This information can be used by a trained ContriMix model to create synthetic images to improve the performance of existing classifiers. ContriMix outperforms competing methods on the Camelyon17-WILDS dataset. Its performance is consistent across different slides in the test set while being robust to the color variation from rare substances in pathology images.

Specifically, while PHRs are at the patient level and contain sparse information, WSIs are highly information-dense and processed at high resolution. Adjacent to this challenge, specifically in the context of survival analysis under the Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) framework, there are limitations with approximating the hazard function because of varying size WSIs and implicitly limited batch sizes. To address these challenges, we propose SURVIVMIL, a late fusion MIL model that integrates multimodal prognostic data for predicting NB patient outcomes. Our approach fuses predictions from both modalities and incorporates a novel concordance-based loss function via a specifically designed buffer branch, which mitigates the batch size limitation by accumulating survival predictions. Our model is evaluated on an in-house pediatric NB patient dataset, providing insights into the contributions of each modality to predictive performance.

Towards this end, we present a computational pipeline comprising patch analysis of Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E)-stained WSIs, feature encoding with ImageNet pretrained ResNet50, and an attention-based multiple instance learning paradigm. We trained individual models at four distinct magnification levels (20x, 10x, 5x, 2.5x), and assessed the fusion of various ensemble combinations to mimic the WSI assessment by expert pathologists, to capture local and global context. Our results using a multi-scale approach demonstrate 3-9\% improvement in classification accuracy when compared with models utilising a single magnification level. This advancement underscores the efficacy of attention-based models combined with multi-scale approaches in augmenting traditional assessment of WSIs. The implications of our findings are significant in enhancing glioma diagnosis and treatment planning in neuro-oncology, by enabling diagnostics in low-resource environments where molecular profiling is not available.}

Incorporating contextual knowledge into predictions is particularly important given the inclination for cancerous cells to form clusters and the presence of spatial indicators for tumors. State-of-the-art methods often use attention mechanisms eventually combined with graphs to capture spatial knowledge. In this paper, we take a novel and transversal approach, addressing this issue through the lens of regularization. We propose Context-Aware Regularization for Multiple Instance Learning (CARMIL), a versatile regularization scheme designed to seamlessly integrate spatial knowledge into any MIL model. Additionally, we present a new and generic metric to quantify the Context- Awareness of any MIL model when applied to Whole Slide Images, resolving a previously unexplored gap in the field. The efficacy of our framework is evaluated for two survival analysis tasks on glioblastoma (TCGA GBM) and colon cancer data (TCGA COAD).}

However, translating stains from information-poor domains to information-rich ones can lead to a domain shift problem due to the large discrepancy between domains. To address this issue, we propose StairwayToStain (STS), an unsupervised gradual stain translation framework that uses intermediate stains to bridge the gap between the source and target stain. Our method is grounded in three main phases: (i) measuring the domain shift between different stains, (ii) defining a translation path, and (iii) performing the gradual stain translation. Our method demonstrates its efficacy in improving glomeruli segmentation when translating from immunohistochemical (IHC) to histochemical stains, as well as between different IHC stains. Comprehensive experiments on stain translation demonstrate STSâ€™s competitive results compared to its variants and state-of-the-art direct I2I methods in achieving UDA. Moreover, we are able to generate additional stains during the translation process. Our method presents the first framework for gradual domain adaptation in stain translation.}

By integrating information from pathology WSIs with MRI images, this approach aims to create hybrid images that offer a more detailed and comprehensive view of cancer tissue structures. We evaluated our techniques using prostate lesions both on the similarity metrics and downstream segmentation tasks. For the similarity, our reconstructed fusion images can achieve an average 0.933 in structural similarity index. We improved lesion segmentation dice score from 57.3\% to 64.0\% on the test cases.
