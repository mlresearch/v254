abstract: 'Integrating Whole Slide Images (WSIs) and patient-specific health records
  (PHRs) can facilitate survival analysis of high-risk neuroblastoma (NB) cancer patients.
  However, this integration is challenging due to extreme differences in data dimensionality.
  Specifically, while PHRs are at the patient level and contain sparse information,
  WSIs are highly information-dense and processed at high resolution. Adjacent to
  this challenge, specifically in the context of survival analysis under the Multiple
  Instance Learning (MIL) framework, there are limitations with approximating the
  hazard function because of varying size WSIs and implicitly limited batch sizes.
  To address these challenges, we propose SURVIVMIL, a late fusion MIL model that
  integrates multimodal prognostic data for predicting NB patient outcomes. Our approach
  fuses predictions from both modalities and incorporates a novel concordance-based
  loss function via a specifically designed buffer branch, which mitigates the batch
  size limitation by accumulating survival predictions. Our model is evaluated on
  an in-house pediatric NB patient dataset, providing insights into the contributions
  of each modality to predictive performance. The code will be available at: https://github.com/reednaidoo/SurvivMIL_COMPAYL.git'
