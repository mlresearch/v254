  stained ImmunoFluorescence images
booktitle: Proceedings of the MICCAI Workshop on Computational Pathology
abstract: Accurate identification and classification of immune cells within tissue
  samples are critical for understanding disease mechanisms and predicting treatment
  responses as a cornerstone for personalized medicine. Traditional histopathology
  relies on hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining, which provides structural context
  but lacks specificity for immune cell sub-types, preventing pathologists from more
  precise identification. In contrast, immunofluorescent (IF) staining enables precise
  targeting of specific markers, but this recently developed technology is very costly
  and not widely applied in clinical practice yet. In this work, we propose a method
  to leverage registered pairs of H&E and IF stained images from the same tissue to
  automatically generate cell type labels for H&E from IF marker expression, allowing
  for precise identification. In particular, we demonstrate the feasibility of lymphocyte
  sub-typing from H&E images by training cell-level classifiers to accurately distinguish
  T-cells subtypes (CD45 / CD3e / CD4 / CD8a). Full code will be made available.
