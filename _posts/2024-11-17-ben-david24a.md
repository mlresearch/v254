booktitle: Proceedings of the MICCAI Workshop on Computational Pathology
abstract: In this paper, we introduce a novel deep-learning based method for virtual
  stain multiplexing of immunohistochemistry (IHC) stains. Traditional IHC techniques
  generally involve a single stain that highlights a single target protein, but this
  can be enriched with stain multiplexing. Our proposed method leverages sequential
  staining to train a model to virtually stain multiplex additional IHC on top of
  a digitally scanned whole slide image (WSI), without requiring a complex setup or
  any additional tissue sections and stains. To this end, we designed a novel model
  architecture, guided by the physical sequential staining process which provides
  superior performance. The model was optimized using a custom loss function that
  combines mean squared error (MSE) with semantic information, allowing the model
  to focus on learning the relevant differences between the input and ground truth.
  As an example application, we consider the problem of detecting macro-phages on
  PD-L1 IHC 22C3 pharmDx NSCLC WSIs. We demonstrated virtual stain multiplexing CD68
  on top of PD-L1 22C3 pharmDx stained slides, which helps to detect macrophages and
  distinguish them from PD-L1+ tumor cells, which are often visually similar. Our
  pilot-study results showed significant improvement in a pathologist’s ability to
  distinguish macrophages when using the virtually stain multiplexed CD68 decision
  supporting layer.
