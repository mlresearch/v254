  whole-slide images'
booktitle: Proceedings of the MICCAI Workshop on Computational Pathology
abstract: The Segment Anything Model (SAM) marks a significant advancement in segmentation
  models, offering robust zero-shot abilities and dynamic prompting. However, existing
  medical SAMs are not suitable for the multi-scale nature of whole-slide images (WSIs),
  restricting their effectiveness. To resolve this drawback, we present WSI-SAM, enhancing
  SAM with precise object segmentation capabilities for histopathology images using
  multi-resolution patches, while preserving its efficient, prompt-driven design,
  and zero-shot abilities. To fully exploit pretrained knowledge while minimizing
  training overhead, we keep SAM frozen, introducing only minimal extra parameters
  and computational overhead. In particular, we introduce High-Resolution (HR) token,
  Low-Resolution (LR) token and dual mask decoder. This decoder integrates the original
  SAM mask decoder with a lightweight fusion module that integrates features at multiple
  scales. Instead of predicting a mask independently, we integrate HR and LR token
  at intermediate layer to jointly learn features of the same object across multiple
  resolutions. Experiments show that our WSI-SAM outperforms state-of-the-art SAM
  and its variants. In particular, our model outperforms SAM by 4.1 and 2.5 percent
  points on a ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) segmentation tasks and breast cancer
  metastasis segmentation task (CAMELYON16 data set). The code will be available at
