title: Prediction of KRAS mutation status from H&E foundation model embeddings in
  non-small cell lung cancer
booktitle: Proceedings of the MICCAI Workshop on Computational Pathology
abstract: We predicted KRAS mutation status on non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)
  H&E images from foundation model embeddings. We evaluated a variety of attention-based
  multiple instance learning (MIL) models and aggregation strategies for a tilewise
  linear classifier. MIL with self-attention performed the best (AUC=0.822) followed
  by the minimum over tiles classified with the linear model (AUC=0.810). Self-attention
  was necessary for MIL to surpass tilewise linear classification when a wide range
  of aggregation techniques was considered.
