title: Early Fusion of H&E and IHC Histology Images for Pediatric Brain Tumor Classification
booktitle: Proceedings of the MICCAI Workshop on Computational Pathology
abstract: 'This study explores the application of computational pathology to analyze
  pediatric brain tumors utilizing hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and immunohistochemistry
  (IHC) whole slide images (WSIs). Experiments were conducted on H&E images for predicting
  tumor diagnosis and fusing them with unregistered IHC images to investigate potential
  improvements. Patch features were extracted using UNI, a vision transformer (ViT)
  model trained on H&E data, and whole slide classification was achieved using the
  attention-based multiple instance learning CLAM framework. In the astrocytoma tumor
  classification, early fusion of the H&E and IHC significantly improved the differentiation
  between tumor grades (balanced accuracy: 0.82 ± 0.05 vs 0.84 ± 0.05). In the multiclass
  classification, H&E images alone had a balanced accuracy of 0.79 ± 0.03 without
  any improvement obtained when fused with IHC. The findings highlight the potential
  of using multi-stain fusion to advance the diagnosis of pediatric brain tumors,
  however, further fusion methods should be investigated.'
