title: Histopathobiome – integrating histopathology and microbiome data via multimodal
  deep learning
booktitle: Proceedings of the MICCAI Workshop on Computational Pathology
abstract: We introduce Histopathobiome, a term representing the integration of histopathology
  and microbiome data to explore tissue-microbe interactions. Using a dataset of colon
  biopsy whole-slide images paired with microbiota composition samples, we assess
  the benefits of combining these modalities to distinguish patients with inflammatory
  bowel disease (IBD) subtype – ulcerative colitis (UC) from non-IBD controls. Initially,
  we evaluate the unimodal performance of state-of-the-art algorithms using vectors
  representing bacterial species abundances or histopathology slide-level embeddings.
  We compare single-modality models with bimodal networks with various fusion strategies.
  Our results prove that histopathology and microbiome data are complementary in UC
  classification. By demonstrating improved performance over single-modality approaches,
  we prove that bimodal deep learning models can be used to learn meaningful and interpretable
  cross-modal tissue-microbe patterns.
