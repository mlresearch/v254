title: Preprocessing Pathology Reports for Vision-Language Model Development
booktitle: Proceedings of the MICCAI Workshop on Computational Pathology
abstract: Pathology reports are increasingly being used for development of vision-language
  models. Because the reports often include information that cannot directly be derived
  from paired images, careful selection of information is required to prevent hallucinations
  in tasks like report generation. In this paper, we present a language model for
  subsentence segmentation based on the information content, as part of a preprocessing
  workflow for 27,500 pathology reports of cutaneous melanocytic lesions. After initial
  clean up, the reports were first translated from Dutch to English and then segmented
  by separate language models. Both models were developed using an iterative approach,
  in which the development dataset was expanded with manually corrected model predictions
  for previously unannotated reports before finetuning the next version of the models.
  Over the course of eight iterations, the development dataset was in the end scaled
  up to 1,500 translated and annotated reports. On the independent test set of 3,597
  sentences from 150 reports, 219 translation errors (6,1%) of different severities
  were counted. The subsentence segmentation model achieved a strong predictive performance
  on the test set with a macro average F1 -score of 0.921 (95% CI, 0.890-0.940) and
  a weighted average F1 -score of 0.952 (95% CI, 0.944-0.960) over 13 different classes.
  The remaining 25,850 unannotated reports were translated and segmented using the
  final models to complete the dataset preprocessing. Differences in word count and
  class distribution between section types of the reports were explored in preparation
  for future vision-language modeling. The presented methodology is generic and can,
  therefore, easily be extended to multiple or different pathology domains beyond
  melanocytic skin lesions. Code and trained model parameters are made publicly available.
