  Image Segmentation'
booktitle: Proceedings of the MICCAI Workshop on Computational Pathology
abstract: Deep learning models have shown promising performance for Nuclei segmentation
  in the field of pathology image analysis. However, training a robust model from
  multiple domains remains a great challenge for Nuclei segmentation. Additionally,
  the shortcomings of background noise, highly overlapping between Nuclei, and blurred
  edges often lead to poor performance. To address these challenges, we propose a
  novel framework termed CDNet, which combines Causal Inference Module (CIM) with
  Diversified Aggregation Convolution (DAC) techniques. The DAC module is designed
  which incorporates diverse downsampling features through a simple, parameter-free
  attention module (SimAM), aiming to overcome the problems of edge blurring. Furthermore,
  we introduce CIM to leverage sample weighting by directly removing the spurious
  correlations between features for every input sample and concentrating more on the
  correlation between features and labels. Extensive experiments on the MoNuSeg and
  GLySAC datasets yielded promising results, with mean intersection over union (mIoU)
  and Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) scores increasing by 3.59% and 2.61%, and
  2.71% and 2.04%, respectively, outperforming other state-of-the-art methods.
