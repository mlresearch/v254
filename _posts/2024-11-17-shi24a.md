title: Upscaling Prostate Cancer MRI Images to Cell-level Resolution Using Self-supervised
  Learning
booktitle: Proceedings of the MICCAI Workshop on Computational Pathology
abstract: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) plays a pivotal role in medical imaging,
  particularly in the diagnosis and treatment of cancers via radiography. However,
  one of the limitations of MRI is its low spatial resolution, which can hinder the
  accurate detection and characterization of cancerous lesions, especially those that
  are small or subtle in nature. There is a growing need for advancements in MRI technology
  to improve the resolution of MRI, particularly in the field of oncology, where precise
  detection and segmentation of tumors are crucial for effective treatment planning
  and optimal patient outcomes. In this paper, we proposed a self-supervised deep
  learning technique to upscale cancer MRI images to cell-level resolution with pathology
  Whole Slide Imaging (WSI). By integrating information from pathology WSIs with MRI
  images, this approach aims to create hybrid images that offer a more detailed and
  comprehensive view of cancer tissue structures. We evaluated our techniques using
  prostate lesions both on the similarity metrics and downstream segmentation tasks.
  For the similarity, our reconstructed fusion images can achieve an average 0.933
  in structural similarity index. We improved lesion segmentation dice score from
  57.3% to 64.0% on the test cases. Such fusion of the two imaging modalities shows
  promise for improving the accuracy and reliability of cancer diagnosis, guiding
  treatment decisions, and ultimately improving patient outcomes.
