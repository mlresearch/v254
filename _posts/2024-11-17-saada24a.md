title: 'CARMIL: Context-Aware Regularization on Multiple Instance Learning models
  for Whole Slide Images'
booktitle: Proceedings of the MICCAI Workshop on Computational Pathology
abstract: Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) models have proven effective for cancer
  prognosis from Whole Slide Images. However, the original MIL formulation incorrectly
  assumes the patches of the same image to be independent, leading to a loss of spatial
  context as information flows through the network. Incorporating contextual knowledge
  into predictions is particularly important given the inclination for cancerous cells
  to form clusters and the presence of spatial indicators for tumors. State-of-the-art
  methods often use attention mechanisms eventually combined with graphs to capture
  spatial knowledge. In this paper, we take a novel and transversal approach, addressing
  this issue through the lens of regularization. We propose Context-Aware Regularization
  for Multiple Instance Learning (CARMIL), a versatile regularization scheme designed
  to seamlessly integrate spatial knowledge into any MIL model. Additionally, we present
  a new and generic metric to quantify the Context- Awareness of any MIL model when
  applied to Whole Slide Images, resolving a previously unexplored gap in the field.
  The efficacy of our framework is evaluated for two survival analysis tasks on glioblastoma
  (TCGA GBM) and colon cancer data (TCGA COAD).
