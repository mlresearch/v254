abstract: 'The 2021 WHO classification of tumors of the central nervous system necessitates
  the integration of molecular and histologic profiling for a conclusive diagnosis
  of glioma. Molecular profiling is time-consuming and may not always be available.
  We hypothesize that subvisual cues in whole slide images (WSI), not perceivable
  by the naked eye, carry a predictive value of molecular characteristics and can
  allow categorization of the adult infiltrative gliomas in one of three major types:
  i) oligodendroglioma, ii) astrocytoma, and iii) glioblastoma. Towards this end,
  we present a computational pipeline comprising patch analysis of Hematoxylin and
  Eosin (H&E)-stained WSIs, feature encoding with ImageNet pretrained ResNet50, and
  an attention-based multiple instance learning paradigm. We trained individual models
  at four distinct magnification levels (20x, 10x, 5x, 2.5x), and assessed the fusion
  of various ensemble combinations to mimic the WSI assessment by expert pathologists,
  to capture local and global context. Our results using a multi-scale approach demonstrate
  3-9% improvement in classification accuracy when compared with models utilising
  a single magnification level. This advancement underscores the efficacy of attention-based
  models combined with multi-scale approaches in augmenting traditional assessment
  of WSIs. The implications of our findings are significant in enhancing glioma diagnosis
  and treatment planning in neuro-oncology, by enabling diagnostics in low-resource
  environments where molecular profiling is not available.'
