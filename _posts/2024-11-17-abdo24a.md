abstract: 'Image-to-image translation (I2I) has advanced digital pathology by enabling
  knowledge transfer across clinical contexts through unsupervised domain adaptation
  (UDA). Although promising, most I2I frameworks transfer source-labeled data to target
  unlabeled data directly in a one-off way. However, translating stains from information-poor
  domains to information-rich ones can lead to a domain shift problem due to the large
  discrepancy between domains. To address this issue, we propose StairwayToStain (STS),
  an unsupervised gradual stain translation framework that uses intermediate stains
  to bridge the gap between the source and target stain. Our method is grounded in
  three main phases: (i) measuring the domain shift between different stains, (ii)
  defining a translation path, and (iii) performing the gradual stain translation.
  Our method demonstrates its efficacy in improving glomeruli segmentation when translating
  from immunohistochemical (IHC) to histochemical stains, as well as between different
  IHC stains. Comprehensive experiments on stain translation demonstrate STSâ€™s competitive
  results compared to its variants and state-of-the-art direct I2I methods in achieving
  UDA. Moreover, we are able to generate additional stains during the translation
  process. Our method presents the first framework for gradual domain adaptation in
  stain translation.'
