title: Stromal Tissue Segmentation in Multi-Stained Serial Histopathological Sections
  of Pancreatic Tumors
booktitle: Proceedings of the MICCAI Workshop on Computational Pathology
abstract: In this work we propose and compare different deep learning algorithms for
  the segmentation of stromal regions in pancreatic histopathological image using
  three consecutive tissue sections, each uniquely stained with Hematoxylin and Eosin
  (H&E), Masson’s Trichrome, and Alcian Blue. After a non-rigid registration process,
  variations in tissue distribution between consecutive slides still persist, which
  leads to distinct desired segmentations of tissues for each stain, thus underscoring
  the need for a specific segmentation and co-segmentation approaches to achieve higher
  accuracy. We compare single stain models, with respect to multi-stain techniques
  that either consider the multiple stains all at once in training or are based on
  multi-branch siamese and co-segmentation techniques. We demonstrate superior performance
  in identifying stromal regions with the multi-stain approaches in comparison to
  the segmentation techniques applied to individual stains, by effectively utilizing
  the complementary information each staining technique provides. This advancement
  is poised to enhance the further evaluation of tumor microenvironment and stromal
  characteristics in patients with pancreatic cancer.
