booktitle: Proceedings of the MICCAI Workshop on Computational Pathology
abstract: This study focuses on the assessment of Tumor-Infiltrating Lymphocytes (TILs)
  in Breast ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) by integrating artificial intelligence
  with international guidelines. DCIS is a non-invasive cancer with intrinsic potential
  to evolve to invasive breast cancer (IBC), making it critical to understand factors
  influencing this progression. TILs are a prognostic biomarker in IBC, but their
  role in DCIS remains under-explored. This work proposes an automated pipeline for
  computing TILs scores using deep learning for DCIS segmentation and TILs detection,
  following the guidelines of the International Immuno-Oncology Biomarker Working
  Group. We report the inter-observer variability at TILs scoring among Pathologists
  and show that the AI-based TILs scores have good concordance with human assessments.
  Future research will aim to reduce false positives in DCIS segmentation and detection,
  support the reference standard with immunohistochemical staining, and expand the
  dataset to enhance the robustness of the TILs detection algorithm. Ultimately, this
  method aims to aid Pathologists in assessing the risk associated with DCIS lesions.
