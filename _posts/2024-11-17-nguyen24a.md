  domain labels in digital pathology'
booktitle: Proceedings of the MICCAI Workshop on Computational Pathology
abstract: Differences in staining and imaging procedures can cause significant color
  variations in histopathology images, leading to poor generalization when deploying
  deep-learning models trained from a different data source. Various color augmentation
  methods have been proposed to generate synthetic images during training to make
  models more robust, eliminating the need for stain normalization during test time.
  Many color augmentation methods leverage domain labels to generate synthetic images.
  This approach causes three significant challenges to scaling such a model. Firstly,
  incorporating data from a new domain into deep-learning models trained on existing
  domain labels is not straightforward. Secondly, dependency on domain labels prevents
  the use of pathology images without domain labels to improve model performance.
  Finally, implementation of these methods becomes complicated when multiple domain
  labels (e.g., patient identification, medical center, etc) are associated with a
  single image. We introduce ContriMix, a novel domain label free stain color augmentation
  method based on DRIT++, a style-transfer method. ContriMix leverages sample stain
  color variation within a training minibatch and random mixing to extract content
  and attribute information from pathology images. This information can be used by
  a trained ContriMix model to create synthetic images to improve the performance
  of existing classifiers. ContriMix outperforms competing methods on the Camelyon17-WILDS
  dataset. Its performance is consistent across different slides in the test set while
  being robust to the color variation from rare substances in pathology images. Our
  source code and pre-trained checkpoints are available at https://gitlab.com/huutan86
