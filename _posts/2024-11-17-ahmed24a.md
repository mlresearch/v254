title: 'PathAlign: A vision–language model for whole slide images in histopathology'
booktitle: Proceedings of the MICCAI Workshop on Computational Pathology
abstract: Microscopic interpretation of histopathology images underlies many important
  diagnostic and treatment decisions. While advances in vision–language modeling raise
  new oppor- tunities for analysis of such images, the gigapixel-scale size of whole
  slide images (WSIs) introduces unique challenges. Additionally, pathology reports
  simultaneously highlight key findings from small regions while also aggregating
  interpretation across multiple slides, often making it difficult to create robust
  image–text pairs. As such, pathology reports remain a largely untapped source of
  supervision in computational pathology, with most efforts relying on region-of-interest
  annotations or self-supervision at the patch-level. In this work, we develop a vision–language
  model based on the BLIP-2 framework using WSIs paired with curated text from pathology
  reports. This enables applications utilizing a shared image–text embedding space,
  such as text or image retrieval for finding cases of interest, as well as integration
  of the WSI encoder with a frozen large language model (LLM) for WSI-based generative
  text capabilities such as report generation or AI-in-the-loop interactions. We utilize
  a de-identified dataset of over 350,000 WSIs and diagnostic text pairs, spanning
  a wide range of diagnoses, procedure types, and tissue types. We present pathologist
  evaluation of text generation and text retrieval using WSI embeddings, as well as
  results for WSI classification and workflow prioritization (slide-level triaging).
  Model-generated text for WSIs was rated by pathologists as accurate, without clinically
  significant error or omission, for 78% of WSIs on average. This work demonstrates
  exciting potential capabilities for language-aligned WSI embeddings.
