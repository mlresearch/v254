abstract: 'Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI), in particular self-supervised
  learning of foundation models (FMs), are revolutionizing medical imaging and computational
  pathology (CPath). A constant challenge in the analysis of digital Whole Slide Images
  (WSIs) is the problem of aggregating tens of thousands of tile-level image embeddings
  to a slide-level representation. Due to the prevalent use of datasets created for
  genomic research, such as TCGA, for method development, the performance of these
  techniques on diagnostic slides from clinical practice has been inadequately explored.
  This study conducts a thorough benchmarking analysis of ten slide-level aggregation
  techniques across nine clinically relevant tasks, including diagnostic assessment,
  biomarker classification, and outcome prediction. The results yield following key
  insights: (1) Embeddings derived from domainspecific (histological images) FMs outperform
  those from generic ImageNet-based models across aggregation methods. (2) Spatial-aware
  aggregators enhance the performance significantly when using ImageNet pre-trained
  models but not when using FMs. (3) No single model excels in all tasks and spatially-aware
  models do not show general superiority as it would be expected. These findings underscore
  the need for more adaptable and universally applicable aggregation techniques, guiding
  future research towards tools that better meet the evolving needs of clinical-AI
  in pathology. The code used in this work are available at https://github.com/fuchs-lab-public/CPath_SABenchmark'
